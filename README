This is just a Hello World program in Frost, to serve as a demonstration of how to use CMake to
build a Frost project.

To build this project, first ensure that you have the directory containing frostc in your PATH, and
then (starting from the project root) run:

   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make

This should create a program named "hello" in the build directory.
